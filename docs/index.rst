reference-sequence-fetcher's documentation
==========================================

reference-sequence-fetcher is a python client to retrieve sequence and metadata
from reference servers in a user friendly and easy to use manner. It has requests
library at its heart and allows you to fetch sequences using a Fetcher object.

An example would be like::

    >>from reference_sequence_fetcher import fetcher
    >>fethcer = Fetcher('yourserver.com')
    >>fetcher.fetch_sequence('<checksum>')
    >>ATGCATCGACTG.......ATGCATCGACTG

Fetcher object typically has two methods:
 * `fetch_sequence` to fetch the sequence metadata
 * `fetch_metadata` to fetch the metadata of the sequence

and two class methods `sequenece` and `metadata`
